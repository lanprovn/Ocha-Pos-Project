## 🚀 1. Quick Scaffolding

Set up your mission-critical environment in 30 seconds using the CLI:

```sh
# 1. Create a new project (Recommended)
npx antigravity-ide my_project

# 2. Smart install in current directory
npx antigravity-ide
```

### ✨ Setup Wizard Features (v4.0.0 - Big Update)
The new interactive CLI puts you in control with a **Scale-Adaptive Engine**:

1.  **Scale-Adaptive Architecture**:
    - **Flexible (Solo-Ninja)**: Optimized for speed. Hybrid agents with cross-domain capabilities. Fast-track execution.
    - **Balanced (Agile-Squad)**: Coordinated workflow with plan verification. Focused specialist agents.
    - **Strict (Software-Factory)**: Enterprise-grade standardization. Mandatory security audits and quality gates.

2.  **Scientific Metadata Linkage**:
    - **Unified Connection**: Every file in `.agent` is linked via YAML metadata to its **DNA** (`.shared`), **Rules** (`rules/`), and **Skills** (`skills/`).
    - **Context-Aware Invocations**: Agents automatically summon the right knowledge based on the file domain and project scale.

3.  **Smart Allocation Logic**:
    - **Scale (Quy mô)**: Determines the **Operation Mode** (Ninja vs Squad vs Factory) and **Compliance Depth**.
    - **Product Type**: Automatically loads the exact **Skills & Workflows** you need:
        - 📱 **User Application**: App/Web/Mobile/Desktop (Activates *WebDev/Mobile/Testing/UIUX* Skills).
        - 🛠️ **Developer Tool**: CLI/Library/API (Activates *DevOps/Testing* Skills).
        - 🤖 **AI Agent**: Chatbot/Automation (Activates *AI/Maker/Research* Skills).
        - 🎨 **Digital Asset**: Game/Template/Media (Activates *GameDev/SEO/UIUX* Skills).

4.  **Context Injection**:
    - **Name your Agent**: Personalize your AI (e.g., *Jarvis*, *Friday*).
    - **Multi-Persona Orchestration**: Coordinate up to 15 specialist agents through a unified command.
    - *Auto-Injection*: These details are deeply embedded into `.agent/rules/GEMINI.md`.

5.  **Security & Learning Systems (v4.0.x)**:
    - **🛡️ Malware Protection**: Automatic scanning of malicious URLs and links before loading external resources.
    - **🔄 Auto-Update Chat**: AI proactively checks NPM for new versions and offers to upgrade via chat.
    - **🐛 Error Logging**: AI automatically logs all errors to `ERRORS.md` for analysis and learning (v4.0.2).
    - **📊 Smart Prevention**: Classifies errors by Type/Severity, suggests fixes, and prevents recurrence.
    - **🎓 Self-Learning**: Errors repeated ≥ 2 times → AI auto-creates new Rules or Test cases.

### Engine Modes
- **⚡ Standard (Node.js)**: High-speed, lightweight, perfect for Web/SaaS projects.
- **🧠 Advanced (Python)**: Deep AI integration, Data Science, and automated Security Scanners.

### Identity Awareness & Brain-Drop Protection
You can assign a unique name to your Agent (e.g., *Jarvis*). This acts as an "Identity Anchor" to verify if the AI is still adhering to the system rules and operational flow.

## 🧠 2. The Core Brain: `.agent` Folder

The `.agent` directory is where the system's intelligence resides:

- **Specialist Agent System**: Includes the Project Planner, Backend/Frontend Specialists, Security Auditor, and the Orchestrator (Captain).
- **PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**: AI doesn't just "write code." It follows a rigorous Plan -> Implement -> Inspect -> Approve cycle.
- **Shared Knowledge DNA (`.shared/`)**: Contains the project's core principles, including API Standards, DB Schemas, Compliance docs, and Domain Blueprints (Fintech, Edtech, etc.).

---

## ⚡ 3. Slash Commands (`/`) & Updates

Trigger deep workflows directly within your AI chat interface:

- `/plan`: Outline requirements and break down tasks (Project Planner).
- `/create`: Scaffold the project's foundation.
- `/ui-ux-pro-max`: Design premium interfaces & micro-interactions.
- `/orchestrate`: Coordinate multiple agents to solve complex problems.
- `/update`: Check for updates and upgrade Antigravity IDE to the latest version.
- `/log-error`: Auto error logging (runs in background, no manual invocation needed).

### System Updates
Update the Antigravity Brain to the latest version while preserving your custom configurations:
```sh
npx antigravity-ide update
```
